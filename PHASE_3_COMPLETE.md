## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Trial JSON Data**: Enhanced features require full trial JSON data. If `data/raw/{NCT_ID}.json` files don't exist, enhanced sections will show "Enhanced data not available"

2. **Session State**: Referral tracker, email alerts, and similar patients analyzer are initialized in session state

3. **Privacy**: All patient data is anonymized (age buckets, hashed emails, no PHI)

4. **Performance**: Expandable sections load data on-demand (lazy loading)

5. **Mobile**: All new features are mobile-responsive via CSS from Phase 1

---

1. Start the app
2. Test all 10 features
3. Fix any bugs found
4. Get oncologist feedback

### Option B: Add Data First
