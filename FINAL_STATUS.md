- ⚙️ Settings Tab (email alerts, resources, EMR guide)

**Plus trial card enhancements:**

### ⚠️ Known Issue: Data Loading

**Problem:** The trial_card_enhancer.py is trying to load individual JSON files, but the data exists as a JSONL file.

**Files:**
- ✅ EXISTS: `data/raw/cervical_cancer_20251002_141658.jsonl` (9.7MB)
- ✅ EXISTS: All processed parquet files in `data/clean/`
- ❌ MISSING: Individual JSON files per NCT ID

**Impact:** Enhanced features show "Enhanced data not available" message

**Solution:** Update `trial_card_enhancer.py` to load from JSONL file instead

## 🐛 Current Issues

### Issue #1: JSONL vs JSON File Format
**Severity:** Medium (features exist but show "not available")

**Current behavior:**
```python
# trial_card_enhancer.py tries to load:
data/raw/{NCT_ID}.json  # ❌ Doesn't exist

# But data actually exists as:
data/raw/cervical_cancer_20251002_141658.jsonl  # ✅ Exists!
```

**Solution:** Update `load_trial_json()` function to:
1. Try individual JSON files first
2. Fall back to parsing JSONL file
3. Cache parsed trials in memory

### Issue #2: Multiple Zombie Streamlit Processes
**Severity:** Low (cleanup issue)

**Current:** 18+ background Streamlit processes running
**Solution:** Use process_manager.py cleanup on exit

---

## 🚀 Quick Fix for Data Loading

To make ALL enhanced features work immediately, update `trial_card_enhancer.py`:

```python
def load_trial_json(nct_id: str) -> dict:
    """Load full trial JSON data for enhanced features."""
    # Try JSONL file first
    raw_data_path = Path("data/raw")

    # Find JSONL files
    jsonl_files = list(raw_data_path.glob("*.jsonl"))

    for jsonl_file in jsonl_files:
        try:
            with open(jsonl_file, 'r') as f:
                for line in f:
                    trial = json.loads(line)
                    trial_nct = trial.get("protocolSection", {}).get("identificationModule", {}).get("nctId", "")
                    if trial_nct == nct_id:
                        return trial
        except:
            continue

    return {}
```

This one change will make ALL enhanced features work!

## 📋 What's Left (The 10 New Requests)

The oncologist's new list of 10 items:

1. ⏳ Load actual trial data - **EASY FIX** (update one function)
2. ⏳ Batch referral creation - ~2 hours
3. ⏳ Patient profile saving - ~1 hour
4. ⏳ Update trial comparison with new columns - ~1 hour
5. ⏳ Create dashboard/home page - ~2 hours
6. ⏳ Export multiple trials to EMR - ~30 min
7. ⏳ Referral follow-up notifications - ~1 hour
8. ⏳ Trial notes/annotations - ~1 hour
9. ⏳ Search history - ~1 hour
10. ⏳ Data freshness indicators - ~30 min

**Total Estimated Time:** ~10-12 hours for all 10 items

---

## 🎯 Immediate Next Step

**Option A: Quick Fix (15 minutes)**
Update `load_trial_json()` in `trial_card_enhancer.py` to read JSONL file.
→ All enhanced features will work immediately!

**Option B: Continue with New Features (10-12 hours)**
Implement all 10 new oncologist requests.

**Option C: Test & Deploy Current Version**
- App is 90% complete
- All infrastructure in place
- Just needs data loading fix

---

## 💡 Recommendation

**DO OPTION A FIRST** (15 minutes to fix data loading), then:
- Test all enhanced features with real data
- Get oncologist feedback
- Decide if the 10 new features are still needed

The enhanced features might address many of the new requests once they're actually visible with real data!
