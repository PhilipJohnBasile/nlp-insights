# Screenshots

To generate screenshots:

1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run trials/app.py
   ```

2. Take screenshots of each tab:
   - **Explore Tab**: Show filters, search, and data table
   - **Eligibility Explorer**: Show search with highlighted terms
   - **Risk Analysis**: Show high-risk trials with scores

3. Save screenshots as:
   - `explore.png`
   - `eligibility.png`
   - `risk.png`

4. Update README.md with actual screenshot paths

## Temporary Placeholder

Screenshots will be added after first Streamlit run.

You can also view the app live by running:
```bash
streamlit run trials/app.py
```
