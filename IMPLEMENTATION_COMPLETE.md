## 📖 Documentation

1. **INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step integration instructions
2. **NEW_FEATURES_SUMMARY.md** - Detailed feature descriptions
3. **This file** - Quick implementation summary

## ⏭️ Next Steps

### Immediate (Integration Phase)
1. Read `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` thoroughly
2. Integrate features one-by-one into `app.py`
3. Test each feature as you integrate
4. Get oncologist feedback after each feature

### Short-term (Testing Phase)
1. Unit test all modules
2. Integration test with real trial data
3. Mobile testing on actual devices
4. Performance testing with 100+ trials

### Medium-term (Production Phase)
