## 🐛 Known Issues

### ⚠️ Deprecation Warnings (Harmless)
You'll see warnings about `use_container_width` → `width`. These don't affect functionality - the app works perfectly.

### 🔧 To Fix (Optional):
Find and replace in `trials/app.py`:
- `use_container_width=True` → `width='stretch'`
- `use_container_width=False` → `width='content'`

This is purely cosmetic - the app works fine with the warnings.
