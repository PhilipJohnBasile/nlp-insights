# App Status & Known Issues

## Current Status

The Streamlit app has **indentation errors** after attempting to add sidebar features.

### What Works ✅
- Autocomplete dropdown for disease selection (33+ oncology diseases)
- Data fetching from UI
- Progress tracking
- Cache clearing after fetch
- All 4 tabs created

### What's Broken ❌
- **Indentation errors** in app.py (line 448 and others)
- Tabs 1-3 have inconsistent indentation
- App won't start due to syntax errors

## What Was Added (but broke things)
1. Sidebar with dataset stats
2. "Refresh Data" button
3. "Clear All Data" button with confirmation
4. Better "no data" state handling
5. Enhanced "Fetch Data" tab with file details

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Revert to Last Working Version
The last working version had:
- ✅ 4 tabs (Explore, Eligibility Explorer, Risks, Fetch Data)
- ✅ Autocomplete dropdown for diseases
- ✅ Data fetching with progress bar
- ✅ Auto cache clear and rerun after fetch

**To restore**: Find the version before sidebar was added

### Option 2: Fix Indentation
All code inside `with tab1:` and other tabs needs to be indented by 12 spaces (3 levels)

Current problem areas:
- Line 267-300: Export button and summary stats (wrong indentation)
- Line 335-380: Eligibility tab (wrong indentation)
- Line 385-448: Risks tab (wrong indentation)
- Line 448: st.pyplot(fig) - unexpected indent

## Recommended Quick Fix

**Simple 3-step fix**:

1. **Delete broken sidebar code** (lines 96-143)
2. **Fix tab indentation**: Add 4 spaces to lines after `with tab1:`, `with tab2:`, `with tab3:`
3. **Test**: `python3 -c "import ast; ast.parse(open('trials/app.py').read())"`

## What Should Work (Minimal Feature Set)

For a working MVP, keep:
- ✅ Autocomplete for disease selection (already working)
- ✅ Fetch data from UI (already working)
- ✅ 4 tabs
- ✅ CSV export
- ✅ Risk analysis

Skip for now:
- ❌ Sidebar (causes indentation issues)
- ❌ Clear data button (not critical)
- ❌ Refresh button (user can refresh browser)

## Current File Sizes
- `trials/app.py`: 723 lines (BROKEN - syntax errors)
- `trials/app.py.broken`: 723 lines (backup of broken version)
- `trials/app_needs_fix.py`: 723 lines (another backup)

## Best Path Forward

**Recommendation**: I should create a fresh, clean `app.py` with:
1. All 4 tabs working
2. Autocomplete dropdown (already coded and working)
3. Basic data loading
4. Skip the sidebar/data management features for now

This will get you a **100% working app** immediately, then we can add sidebar features incrementally in a separate session.

**Would you like me to**:
A) Create a fresh clean working app.py (recommended)
B) Try to manually fix all the indentation
C) Something else?
